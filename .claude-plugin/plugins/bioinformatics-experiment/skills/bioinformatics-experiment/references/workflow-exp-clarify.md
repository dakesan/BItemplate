# Experiment Clarification Workflow (exp-clarify)

## Purpose

Identify underspecified areas in an experiment plan and resolve them through targeted Q&A (max 5 questions). This prevents wasted computational resources and ensures the experiment is well-defined before execution.

## When to Use

Run AFTER creating an experiment plan with exp-plan and BEFORE starting the actual experiment.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Parse Experiment Number

From arguments or ask user:
- Format: Exp## (e.g., Exp01)

### 2. Load Context

- Read `pyproject.toml` section `[tool.bioinfo-experiment.compute]` for default resources
- Find labnote: `notebook/labnote/Exp##_*.md`
- If labnote not found, instruct user to run exp-plan first

### 3. Perform Coverage Scan

For each category, mark status: **Clear** / **Partial** / **Missing**

#### Experiment Objective & Scope
- Research question clearly stated (what biological question)
- Expected outcome defined (qualitative or quantitative)
- Explicit out-of-scope items

#### Input Data (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Absolute path** to input file(s) specified
- Data format explicit (FASTQ, BAM, VCF, CSV, HDF5, etc.)
- Sample information (single/multiple, paired-end/single-end)
- Data scale specified (coverage depth, file size, number of samples)
- Quality assumptions or preprocessing status

#### Output Specification (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Absolute path** to output directory specified
- Output format defined (VCF, BAM, TSV, HDF5, etc.)
- Expected file naming convention
- Intermediate files handling (keep/delete)

#### Analysis Method
- Tool/algorithm choice justified (why this tool)
- Key parameters identified (not all, just critical ones)
- Reference data specified (genome version, annotation source, database versions)

#### Success Criteria & Validation
- Quantitative metrics defined (coverage ≥30X, Q-score ≥20, etc.)
- Expected result range (number of variants, genes, clusters)
- Validation strategy (visual inspection, known controls, sanity checks)

#### Compute Resources
- Threads (default: 90 from pyproject.toml, adjust if needed)
- Memory (default: 358GB from pyproject.toml, adjust if needed)
- Estimated runtime (hours/days)
- Disk space required

#### Edge Cases & Failure Handling
- What constitutes failed run (error codes, missing output)
- How to handle low-quality data (thresholds for rejection)
- Retry strategy if applicable

#### Biological Context
- Hypothesis or biological question
- How results inform research goals
- Interpretation criteria (what makes a "good" result biologically)

### 4. Generate Prioritized Questions (Max 5)

Priority ranking (ask in this order):
1. **Path specification** (input/output) - CRITICAL
2. **Data format & scale** - prevents wrong tool choice
3. **Success criteria** - prevents uninterpretable results
4. **Tool/parameter rationale** - prevents poor analysis choices
5. **Biological context** - ensures meaningful interpretation

Each question must be answerable with:
- Multiple choice (2-5 options), OR
- Short answer (≤10 words for paths, ≤5 words otherwise)

Skip questions if:
- Already clearly specified in labnote
- Low impact on analysis outcome
- Better deferred to execution phase

### 5. Sequential Questioning (Interactive)

Present ONE question at a time.

For multiple choice:
```
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A      | [Option A description] |
| B      | [Option B description] |
| C      | [Option C description] |
| Short  | Provide custom answer (≤5 words) |
```

For path questions:
- Format: Absolute path (e.g., /data/raw/sample.fastq.gz)

For short answer:
- Format: Short answer (≤5 words)

After each answer:
- Validate format (path exists? format reasonable?)
- Record in memory
- Proceed to next question

Stop when:
- All critical items resolved, OR
- User signals completion ("done", "stop", "skip"), OR
- 5 questions reached

### 6. Integration (Incremental Update)

After EACH answer:

1. Maintain in-memory labnote content
2. Ensure `## Clarifications` section exists (add after `## Objective` if missing)
3. Add session header: `### Clarification Session YYYY-MM-DD`
4. Append: `- Q: [question] → A: [answer]`

Update corresponding sections:
- **Input Data** answer → Update "Input Data" section with absolute path, format, scale
- **Output** answer → Update "Expected Output" with path, format
- **Objective** answer → Refine research question or scope
- **Method** answer → Add tool justification, parameter rationale
- **Success criteria** answer → Add quantitative thresholds
- **Resources** answer → Override project defaults if needed
- **Edge cases** answer → Add to "Notes" section

Replace vague statements:
- "quality data" → "Q-score ≥20"
- "sufficient coverage" → "≥30X mean coverage"
- "some samples" → "12 tumor-normal pairs"

Save file immediately after each integration (atomic write)

### 7. Validation (After Each Write)

- Clarifications section has exactly one bullet per answer
- Total questions asked ≤ 5
- Input/Output paths are absolute (start with /)
- No contradictory statements remain
- Vague terms replaced with specifics
- Markdown structure valid

### 8. Report Completion

```
✓ Clarification complete for Exp##

Questions answered: X/5
Labnote updated: notebook/labnote/Exp##_description.md

Sections modified:
- Input Data (path, format, scale specified)
- Expected Output (path and format defined)
- Success Criteria (metrics added)

Coverage Summary:
| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Objective & Scope | ✓ Resolved |
| Input Data | ✓ Resolved |
| Output Specification | ✓ Resolved |
| Analysis Method | Clear (sufficient) |
| Success Criteria | ✓ Resolved |
| Compute Resources | Clear (using defaults) |
| Edge Cases | Deferred (low impact) |
| Biological Context | Clear (sufficient) |

Recommendation: Ready to proceed with experiment
Next: Start analysis or run exp-update-labnote as you progress
```

## Behavior Rules

- **ALWAYS prioritize path clarification first** (input and output)
- If no critical ambiguities, report "Experiment plan sufficiently clear" and suggest proceeding
- If labnote missing, instruct to run exp-plan first
- Never exceed 5 questions total
- For paths, validate they look reasonable (absolute, correct extension)
- Don't ask about minor parameter tuning unless critical
- Respect early termination signals
- If compute resources not mentioned, assume pyproject.toml defaults (90 cores, 358GB RAM)
- Flag high-impact unresolved items if quota reached

## Focus Areas

Prevent:
- Missing or wrong input files (wasted setup time)
- Undefined output locations (lost results)
- Uninterpretable results (no success criteria)
- Wrong tool/parameters (wasted compute)
- Unmet biological objectives (misaligned analysis)
